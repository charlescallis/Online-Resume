    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3><p>I am an organized and well-motivated Electronics Engineer with 12 years of post-graduation experience in Network Implementation projects both on-site and remotely, specializing in network automation, radio frequency/microwave transmission, and Radio Access Networks. I am well-versed with a range of high-end communication equipment and techniques.</p>
        <p>I have also gained various computer application, networking, and programming skills which include Linux, python, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Microsoft PowerPoint, TCP/IP, OSPF (multi-area), RIP, ISIS, VLANs, STP, C++, and a few tools for radio frequency analysis, earth testing, and project management. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, I have deployed, implemented, operated, and managed various 2G/3G/4G BTS technologies as well as EBAND, MIMO, SD, and access links microwave technology with different vendor equipment. I possess excellent skills in analyzing packet loss by identifying the time of occurrence, and possible cause, and proffering solutions to customers on the resolution by either hardware/software capacity upgrade or complete hardware replacement.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I am a high-achiever who helped all my previous employers achieve organizational goals. Highlights of my career include winning employee of the month, helping my employer to achieve quarterly implementation targets, and saving operational expenses by streamlining systems and processes.</p>
